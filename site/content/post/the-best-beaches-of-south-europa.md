## Tróia Galé, near Lisbon

Type Sandy

Lifeguard Yes

Cafe/kiosk Yes

About an hour south of Lisbon, the Tróia peninsula stretches for mile upon white sand mile. It is easiest to take a ferry from Setúbal town, with the chance of seeing dolphins, but it’s also possible to drive in just over an hour, via the resort of Comporta. Tróia Galé beach is quiet and has a wonderful location, with views of the Arrábida mountains. The Atlantic is calmer in this bay, and good for swimming. Tróia Residence has apartments near the ocean – from €107 in June.

## Samoqueira, Alentejo

Type Sandy

Lifeguard No

Cafe/kiosk No

This small beach is on a rocky cove north of the whitewashed village of Porto Covo on the rugged southern Alentejo coast. Some are put off by the many steps down the cliff, so it’s quieter than the main beach in the village itself. At low tide, small lagoons form fun areas for children to splash about in and explore. Camping Porto Covo is 500 metres from the sea, has a pool and pitches for two start at €12 a night, and bungalows from €50.

## Culatra, Algarve

Type Sandy

Lifeguard Yes

Cafe/kiosk MarAmais

One of several golden sandy islands off the eastern Algarve, and inhabited by an active fishing community, Culatra is accessible by ferry from Olhão and Faro. There are a lot of fishing boats and houses on its northern lagoon side, but on the ocean side it is possible to find deserted spots among the beautiful dunes. In Olhão old town, close to the market and waterfront, O Convento (doubles from €125 B&B in June) has nine white, airy bedrooms. From the courtyard a winding stone staircase leads to a rooftop pool where you can watch the sun set beyond the lagoon.

## Figueira da Foz, Central

Type Sandy

Lifeguard Yes

Cafe/kiosk Din’s Bar

This is the largest beach in Portugal – be prepared to do some exercise to get to the sea – with wooden boardwalks across the vast, sandy expanse. Around 40km west of the city of Coimbra, Figueira da Foz is one of the oldest beach towns in the country, has salt pans and a salt museum, and is handy for the hilly Serra da Boa Viagem headland, with good spots for picnics. Central Guest House, in the city centre and close to the beach and casino, has en suite doubles from €40 B&B in June.

## Playa de Carnota, Galicia

At 7km long, this half-moon beach is considered the longest in Galicia. Far from any urban area, it has rolling dunes, Colgate-white sand, salt marshes and mountain views. The beach is relatively unfrequented, even by locals, and is a spectacular place to appreciate the Galician coastline away from the region’s more famous haunts. It is accessible by car but lacks amenities like showers. Try zamburiñas (scallops), and chipirones (baby squid) at A Morosa, off the main road above the beach. Stay at Casa Rural San Cibran (doubles from €50 B&B), a 15-minute drive north.
